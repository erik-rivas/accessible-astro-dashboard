# What is Pokémon?


Pokémon, short for "Pocket Monsters," is a media franchise created by Satoshi Tajiri and Ken Sugimori, and is managed by The Pokémon Company, a collaboration between three companies: Nintendo, Game Freak, and Creatures Inc. The franchise was created in 1996 and centers around fictional creatures called "Pokémon."

Players, known as Pokémon Trainers, catch and train Pokémon to battle other Pokémon for sport. The franchise began with a pair of video games for the original Game Boy that were developed by Game Freak and published by Nintendo. It has since expanded into a multi-platform franchise including video games, a trading card game, an animated television series, movies, toys, books, and much more.

The Pokémon universe includes over 800 fictional species of creatures, each with its own unique design, skills, and abilities. The goal of most Pokémon games is to capture and train these creatures, often to become the Pokémon Champion.

The franchise's slogan, "Gotta Catch 'Em All," reflects the gameplay of the main series of role-playing games (RPGs), where the player must collect a variety of different Pokémon species. The Pokémon series is well-known for its ability to foster a sense of adventure, strategy, and community among its players.
