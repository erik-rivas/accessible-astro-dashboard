# History?

The main idea behind Pok√©mon was conceived by Satoshi Tajiri. Tajiri grew up in Machida, a suburb of Tokyo. In his youth, he enjoyed discovering and catching insects and other small creatures in the various ponds and fields that surrounded his town.[28][29] As Japan's economic miracle occurred, many cities, including Machida, were significantly expanded. As a consequence, Machida's nature was largely destroyed. In his second year of junior high school,[30][31] an arcade hall opened in Tajiri's neighborhood, introducing him to video games. While studying electrical engineering at Tokyo College of Technology [ja], Tajiri began publishing a doujinshi magazine titled Game Freak.[32] The title was inspired by the 1932 film Freaks, which Tajiri was fascinated with at the time.[33] He self-published the first issue of the magazine in March 1983, at the age of 17.[34][35] At the time, magazines specializing in video games did not yet exist in Japan, allowing Game Freak to fill a gap in the market.[36][37] Concurrently, Tajiri was contacted by aspiring manga artist Ken Sugimori, who became Game Freak's illustrator.[38] Game Freak folded in the late 1980s,[34] by which point Tajiri had become a respected game journalist in Japan's fledgling video game industry.[39]
